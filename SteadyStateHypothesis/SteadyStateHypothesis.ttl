	rdfs:comment "DC side of the current source converter (CSC).\nThe firing angle controls the dc voltage at the converter, both for rectifier and inverter. The difference between the dc voltages of the rectifier and inverter determines the dc current. The extinction angle is used to limit the dc voltage at the inverter, if needed, and is not used in active power control. The firing angle, transformer tap position and number of connected filters are the primary means to control a current source dc line. Higher level controls are built on top, e.g. dc voltage, dc current and active power. From a steady state perspective it is sufficient to specify the wanted active power transfer (ACDCConverter.targetPpcc) and the control functions will set the dc voltage, dc current, firing angle, transformer tap position and number of connected filters to meet this. Therefore attributes targetAlpha and targetGamma are not applicable in this case.\nThe reactive power consumed by the converter is a function of the firing angle, transformer tap position and number of connected filter, which can be approximated with half of the active power. The losses is a function of the dc voltage and dc current.\nThe attributes minAlpha and maxAlpha define the range of firing angles for rectifier operation between which no discrete tap changer action takes place. The range is typically 10-18 degrees.\nThe attributes minGamma and maxGamma define the range of extinction angles for inverter operation between which no discrete tap changer action takes place.

	rdfs:comment "A control area is a grouping of generating units and/or loads and a cutset of tie lines (as terminals) which may be used for a variety of purposes including automatic generation control, power flow solution area interchange control specification, and input to load forecasting. All generation and load within the area defined by the terminals on the border are considered in the area interchange control. Note that any number of overlapping control area specifications can be superimposed on the physical model. The following general principles apply to ControlArea:\n1.  The control area orientation for net interchange is positive for an import, negative for an export.\n2.  The control area net interchange is determined by summing flows in Terminals. The Terminals are identified by creating a set of TieFlow objects associated with a ControlArea object. Each TieFlow object identifies one Terminal.\n3.  In a single network model, a tie between two control areas must be modelled in both control area specifications, such that the two representations of the tie flow sum to zero.\n4.  The normal orientation of Terminal flow is positive for flow into the conducting equipment that owns the Terminal. (i.e. flow from a bus into a device is positive.) However, the orientation of each flow in the control area specification must align with the control area convention, i.e. import is positive. If the orientation of the Terminal flow referenced by a TieFlow is positive into the control area, then this is confirmed by setting TieFlow.positiveFlowIn flag TRUE. If not, the orientation must be reversed by setting the TieFlow.positiveFlowIn flag FALSE."^^rdf:XMLLiteral .

The most specific subtype of RegulatingControl shall be used in case such equipment participate in the control, e.g. TapChangerControl for tap changers.\nFor flow control, load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a TopologicalNode (bus) into the conducting equipment.\nThe attribute minAllowedTargetValue and maxAllowedTargetValue are required in the following cases:\n- For a power generating module operated in power factor control mode to specify maximum and minimum power factor values;\n- Whenever it is necessary to have an off center target voltage for the tap changer regulator. For instance, due to long cables to off shore wind farms and the need to have a simpler setup at the off shore transformer platform, the voltage is controlled from the land at the connection point for the off shore wind farm. Since there usually is a voltage rise along the cable, there is typical and overvoltage of up 3-4 kV compared to the on shore station. Thus in normal operation the tap changer on the on shore station is operated with a target set point, which is in the lower parts of the dead band.\nThe attributes minAllowedTargetValue and maxAllowedTargetValue are not related to the attribute targetDeadband and thus they are not treated as an alternative of the targetDeadband. They are needed due to limitations in the local substation controller. The attribute targetDeadband is used to prevent the power flow from move the tap position in circles (hunting) that is to be used regardless of the attributes minAllowedTargetValue and maxAllowedTargetValue."^^rdf:XMLLiteral .
