The firing angle controls the dc voltage at the converter, both for rectifier and inverter. The difference between the dc voltages of the rectifier and inverter determines the dc current. The extinction angle is used to limit the dc voltage at the inverter, if needed, and is not used in active power control. The firing angle, transformer tap position and number of connected filters are the primary means to control a current source dc line. Higher level controls are built on top, e.g. dc voltage, dc current and active power. From a steady state perspective it is sufficient to specify the wanted active power transfer (ACDCConverter.targetPpcc) and the control functions will set the dc voltage, dc current, firing angle, transformer tap position and number of connected filters to meet this. Therefore attributes targetAlpha and targetGamma are not applicable in this case.
The reactive power consumed by the converter is a function of the firing angle, transformer tap position and number of connected filter, which can be approximated with half of the active power. The losses is a function of the dc voltage and dc current.
The attributes minAlpha and maxAlpha define the range of firing angles for rectifier operation between which no discrete tap changer action takes place. The range is typically 10-18 degrees.
The attributes minGamma and maxGamma define the range of extinction angles for inverter operation between which no discrete tap changer action takes place. The range is typically 17-20 degrees."

This model represents older systems, in particular those DC commutator exciters with non-continuously acting regulators that were commonly used before the development of the continuously acting varieties.  These systems respond at basically two different rates, depending upon the magnitude of voltage error. For small errors, adjustment is made periodically with a signal to a motor-operated rheostat. Larger errors cause resistors to be quickly shorted or inserted and a strong forcing signal applied to the exciter. Continuous motion of the motor-operated rheostat occurs for these larger error signals, even though it is bypassed by contactor action.

This model is used to represent a fraction of an ordinary load as ""induction motor load"".  It allows a load that is treated as an ordinary constant power in power flow analysis to be represented by an induction motor in dynamic simulation. This model is intended for representation of aggregations of many motors dispersed through a load represented at a high voltage bus but where there is no information on the characteristics of individual motors.
Either a ""one-cage"" or ""two-cage"" model of the induction machine can be modelled. Magnetic saturation is not modelled.
This model treats a fraction of the constant power part of a load as a motor. During initialisation, the initial power drawn by the motor is set equal to <i>Pfrac</i> times the constant <i>P</i> part of the static load.  The remainder of the load is left as a static load.
The reactive power demand of the motor is calculated during initialisation as a function of voltage at the load bus. This reactive power demand can be less than or greater than the constant <i>Q</i> component of the load.  If the motor's reactive demand is greater than the constant <i>Q</i> component of the load, the model inserts a shunt capacitor at the terminal of the motor to bring its reactive demand down to equal the constant <i>Q</i> reactive load.  
If an induction motor load model and a static load model are both present for a load, the motor <i>Pfrac</i> is assumed to be subtracted from the power flow constant <i>P</i> load before the static load model is applied.  The remainder of the load, if any, is then represented by the static load model."
