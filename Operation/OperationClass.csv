http://iec.ch/TC57/2013/CIM-schema-cim16#Limit,http://iec.ch/TC57/2013/CIM-schema-cim16#IdentifiedObject,Limit,"Specifies one limit value for a Measurement. A Measurement typically has several limits that are kept together by the LimitSet class. The actual meaning and use of a Limit instance (i.e., if it is an alarm or warning limit or if it is a high or low limit) is not captured in the Limit class. However the name of a Limit instance may indicate both meaning and use."
http://iec.ch/TC57/2013/CIM-schema-cim16#LimitSet,http://iec.ch/TC57/2013/CIM-schema-cim16#IdentifiedObject,LimitSet,Specifies a set of Limits that are associated with a Measurement. A Measurement may have several LimitSets corresponding to seasonal or other changing conditions. The condition is captured in the name and description attributes. The same LimitSet may be used for several Measurements. In particular percentage limits are used this way.
http://iec.ch/TC57/2013/CIM-schema-cim16#Measurement,http://iec.ch/TC57/2013/CIM-schema-cim16#IdentifiedObject,Measurement,"A Measurement represents any measured, calculated or non-measured non-calculated quantity. Any piece of equipment may contain Measurements, e.g. a substation may have temperature measurements and door open indications, a transformer may have oil temperature and tank pressure measurements, a bay may contain a number of power flow measurements and a Breaker may contain a switch status measurement. 
The PSR - Measurement association is intended to capture this use of Measurement and is included in the naming hierarchy based on EquipmentContainer. The naming hierarchy typically has Measurements as leaves, e.g. Substation-VoltageLevel-Bay-Switch-Measurement.
Some Measurements represent quantities related to a particular sensor location in the network, e.g. a voltage transformer (VT) or potential transformer (PT) at a busbar or a current transformer (CT) at the bar between a breaker and an isolator. The sensing position is not captured in the PSR - Measurement association. Instead it is captured by the Measurement - Terminal association that is used to define the sensing location in the network topology. The location is defined by the connection of the Terminal to ConductingEquipment. 
If both a Terminal and PSR are associated, and the PSR is of type ConductingEquipment, the associated Terminal should belong to that ConductingEquipment instance.
When the sensor location is needed both Measurement-PSR and Measurement-Terminal are used. The Measurement-Terminal association is never used alone."
