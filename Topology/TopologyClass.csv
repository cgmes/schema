http://iec.ch/TC57/2013/CIM-schema-cim16#ACDCConverterDCTerminal,http://iec.ch/TC57/2013/CIM-schema-cim16#DCBaseTerminal,ACDCConverterDCTerminal,A DC electrical connection point at the AC/DC converter. The AC/DC converter is electrically connected also to the AC side. The AC connection is inherited from the AC conducting equipment in the same way as any other AC equipment. The AC/DC converter DC terminal is separate from generic DC terminal to restrict the connection with the AC side to AC/DC converter and so that no other DC conducting equipment can be connected to the AC side.

http://iec.ch/TC57/2013/CIM-schema-cim16#DCBaseTerminal,http://iec.ch/TC57/2013/CIM-schema-cim16#ACDCTerminal,DCBaseTerminal,An electrical connection point at a piece of DC conducting equipment. DC terminals are connected at one physical DC node that may have multiple DC terminals connected. A DC node is similar to an AC connectivity node. The model requires that DC connections are distinct from AC connections.

http://iec.ch/TC57/2013/CIM-schema-cim16#TopologicalNode,http://iec.ch/TC57/2013/CIM-schema-cim16#IdentifiedObject,TopologicalNode,"For a detailed substation model a topological node is a set of connectivity nodes that, in the current network state, are connected together through any type of closed switches, including  jumpers. Topological nodes change as the current network state changes (i.e., switches, breakers, etc. change state).
For a planning model, switch statuses are not used to form topological nodes. Instead they are manually created or deleted in a model builder tool. Topological nodes maintained this way are also called ""busses""."
