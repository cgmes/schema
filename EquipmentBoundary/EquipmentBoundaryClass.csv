http://iec.ch/TC57/2013/CIM-schema-cim16#BaseVoltage,http://iec.ch/TC57/2013/CIM-schema-cim16#IdentifiedObject,BaseVoltage,Defines a system base voltage which is referenced. 
http://iec.ch/TC57/2013/CIM-schema-cim16#Bay,http://iec.ch/TC57/2013/CIM-schema-cim16#EquipmentContainer,Bay,"A collection of power system resources (within a given substation) including conducting equipment, protection relays, measurements, and telemetry.  A bay typically represents a physical grouping related to modularization of equipment."
http://iec.ch/TC57/2013/CIM-schema-cim16#BoundaryPoint,http://iec.ch/TC57/2013/CIM-schema-cim16#PowerSystemResource,BoundaryPoint,"Designates a connection point at which one or more model authority sets shall connect to. The location of the connection point as well as other properties are agreed between organisations responsible for the interconnection, hence all attributes of the class represent this agreement.  It is primarily used in a boundary model authority set which can contain one or many BoundaryPoint-s among other Equipment-s and their connections."

Power system resources can have measurements associated."
http://iec.ch/TC57/2013/CIM-schema-cim16#SubGeographicalRegion,http://iec.ch/TC57/2013/CIM-schema-cim16#IdentifiedObject,SubGeographicalRegion,A subset of a geographical region of a power system network model.
